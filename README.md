### Research question: Which prescriptions are most likely to be prescribed together to treat patients?

### Steps:

#### 1. Review the dataset to determine shape.

#### 2. Remove any nulls in the rows and columns of the dataset.

#### 3. Create a list from the items in the dataset.

#### 4. Transform the list into a NumPy array.

#### 5. Use the apriori algorithm to analyze the array and assign rules.

#### 6. Assess the strength of the rules through the support, confidence, and lift and adjust as needed.

#### Outcome: Next steps would be to identify patients with prescriptions that match the association rules to determine their diagnosis and cost of treatment. By gathering additional information, such as a patientâ€™s diagnosis, cost of treatment, services received, comorbidities, and readmission, it will help leadership understand the patient population allowing for better strategic decisions for equipment, type of providers to hire, or better ways to care for the patient.
